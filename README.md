# Jimmy's Quest for Condiments

An educational platformer computer game designed for children 6-12 years old.
The game features a burger-shaped cat named Jimmy McFurrson as its protagonist, and allows users to
guide Jimmy through levels by solving elementary-level math problems.

Here, players must compute the given math problem and jump into the box labeled with the correct answer. Selecting the box with the correct answer will grant the player 3 coins, while selecting the wrong answer will deduct one of Jimmy's life points.
